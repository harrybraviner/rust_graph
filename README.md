Rust Graph Type
===============

My own graph type in Rust.
I'm trying to learn Rust development and teach myself about graph algorithms at the same time.

Feedback is welcome.

You are free to copy and reuse this code.

# Features

* Breadth-first traversal.
* Depth-first traversal (partial)
* Ability to read graph from a file.

# Coming soon

* Depth-first traversal directed / non-directed edge processing.
* Depth-first traversal tests.
* Ability to write the graph to a file.
