Rust Graph Type
===============

My own graph type in Rust.
I'm trying to learn Rust development and teach myself about graph algorithms at the same time.

Feedback is welcome.

You are free to copy and reuse this code.

# Todo

* Signature for processing vertices and edges - does it really need the
  parent Vec? Should it also be getting the node state (and hence the
  entry / exit times?)

# Features

* Breadth-first traversal.
* Depth-first traversal.
* Ability to serialize / deserialize graphs.

# Coming soon

* Shortest path finding.
* DAG testing and topological sort.
